# üëÅÔ∏è Real-Time Sclera Analysis using OpenCV & MediaPipe

This project is a **real-time eye analysis tool** built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe** that detects and evaluates **scleral discoloration** to assess potential health indicators like **fatigue**, **jaundice**, and **irritation**.

It extracts the **sclera (white part of the eye)**, analyzes its color, and compares it against reference values for a healthy eye ‚Äî accounting for camera white balance using a calibration step. The system provides **live feedback** with a stable rolling average over recent frames.

## üß† What It Detects

- **Fatigue**: Dullness and low brightness in the sclera
- **Jaundice**: Yellowish tint from potential bilirubin buildup
- **Redness**: Irritation or inflammation of the eye

## üß∞ Tech Stack

| Tool/Library    | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `OpenCV`        | Video capture, image processing, UI          |
| `MediaPipe`     | Facial landmark detection (eyes, pupils)     |
| `NumPy`         | Array math and color analysis                |
| `deque` (Python) | Queue for smoothing results across frames   |

## üß™ How It Works

1. **Facial Landmark Detection**  
   - Uses **MediaPipe Face Mesh** to locate key eye and iris points

2. **Sclera Segmentation**  
   - Pupil location helps isolate the surrounding **sclera** using geometric filtering with NumPy

3. **White Balance Calibration**  
   - Press `C` and hold a **white sheet** in front of the camera  
   - Ensures consistent color detection despite camera auto-correction

4. **Real-Time Color Analysis**  
   - Brightness, **yellowness**, and **redness** metrics are calculated
   - Results are **averaged over the last 10 frames** using a queue for stability

5. **Visual Feedback**  
   - Eye landmarks are drawn for accuracy checking  
   - Mask view isolates only the sclera for debugging or display

|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
